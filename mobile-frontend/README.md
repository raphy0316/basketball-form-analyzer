   ```bash
   cd mobile-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   npm start
   ```

4. Run on iOS:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the app** - The camera screen will appear

5. **Preview** - Review your recorded shot
6. **Analyze** - Tap "Analyze Shot" to send to backend for analysis
7. **Retake** - If needed, tap "Retake" to record again

## API Integration

The app integrates with the backend API at `http://192.168.0.165:8000`:

- **Endpoint**: `/analysis/analyze-video`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`
- **File Key**: `file`

## Configuration

### Backend URL
Update the backend URL in `CameraScreen.js` if needed:
```javascript
const BACKEND_URL = 'http://192.168.0.165:8000';
```

### Recording Settings
Adjust recording parameters in `CameraScreen.js`:
```javascript
const MAX_RECORDING_TIME = 5; // seconds
// Video quality: Camera.Constants.VideoQuality['720p']
```

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Permissions
If camera doesn't work:
1. Check device settings for camera permissions
2. Restart the app
3. Ensure you're testing on a physical device (camera may not work in simulator)

### Network Issues
If analysis fails:
1. Verify backend server is running at `http://192.168.0.165:8000`
2. Check network connectivity
3. Ensure backend endpoint `/analysis/analyze-video` is accessible

### Build Issues
If you encounter build problems:
1. Clear Expo cache: `expo r -c`
2. Delete node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Reset Metro bundler: `npm start -- --reset-cache`

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Create new components in separate files
2. Update `App.js` to include new screens
3. Test thoroughly on physical device

### Styling
The app uses React Native StyleSheet for styling. Follow iOS design guidelines for consistency.
